On the first day I met my tutor who helped me installing my computer in the tech support office. He also gave me several sources of documentation that I had to use to discover the PI system and what exactly the company is doing. I met everybody from different teams and then started **watching learning videos, reading courses, newsletters, documentations and overview of each components**.Then I started the **installation** that I had to do before the development team comes back *(at the end of next week)*. This installation consisted in a "local lab" composed of 5 machines representing a PI system. Those machines are :* **Domain controller** : *windows server*, how handle the domain, computers, users, dhcp, etc.* **PI Server** : *windows server*, store archives and communicates with machines via the interfaces. Data witch is stored in it isn't really friendly user but is efficiently stored especially with time management.* **AF server** : *windows server*, Stores cached data from previous queries, sql server, and allow an easy communication with users. It is the link between machines data and human data.* **Data Access Server** : *windows 10*, Translate ODCB or JDCB language into sql queries or other language for the AF server or PI server. Middleware for ODBC and SQL.* **ODBC Client** : *windows 10*, Client using ODBC driver to send queries through this entire system.During this first week I installed the Domain controller and PI server using video tutorials of the company and the live documentations.## What I have to doDuring next week I will have to install the 3 other virtual machines. I will also try to learn more about Kerberos's role.
