# OSISoft Internship - Week 6

Here is a quick summary of my sixth week.


## Where I was

At the beginning of the week, I didn't exactly know what is the release version using and what should I use instead or how should I change it. So this basically was the objectif of my week : clarifying everything.

## What I did

First of all, I did a lot of researches on the different technologies that the project is using. Here is a quick summary of each key name and its functions :
### SSPI
* Using kerberos
* doesn't establish credentials
* Uses windows socket 2

### SChannel
* Authentication
* link between SSPI and kerberos

### GSS-API
* Using Kerberos to get credentials
* doesn't send in network
* just handle tokens

### GSoap
* Uses openSSL for HTTPS
* Creates connection

### winHTTP
* Server based technology
* Service HTTP
* Establish communication
* Support Kerberos authentication
* Uses SSL 3.0

### openSSL
* Transport
* Secure Socket Layout
* Cryptography

 This "glossary" helped me to understand the project development and which choises we have for the development of a new connection.

What I did then was **building the debug version** of the project and tried to understand how is it working. Here are the files that will interest me the most :

1. ODBCConnection.cpp
1. PI ODBC connection.cpp
1. Connection Helper
1. ThreadContextCreator() -> Pool -> isTruedConnection
2. CreateOrb
3. CreateRdsaConnection

A lot of things seemed strange to me. For example, if I use winHTTP, I couldn't create a Token if the DAS isn't trusted. When the token cannot be created, I couldn't see kerberos messages through the network. Whereas when it is working we can see the token offered by the KDC, and the different flags it have :

![token](img/wire_token_options.PNG)

Maybe one solution to use the existing code without using de domain controller would be to use a delegation token witch can be created from an existing token (*Cf. [delegation token](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/delegation) and [Kerberos concepts](https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-8-x/topics/cm_sg_principal_keytab.html)*).

We can also notice that the connection is working when creating **manually a token** on the client.

**It must exist a difference between Dummy and Boss**. Indeed, with Dummy, if I get a ticket, I can then connect to the DAS. But with boss, I have the expected error when a user isn't trusted : *"Cannot connect to server 'FRATESTAS'."*. Here is the error that I can see when this happens :

![KRB_BADOPTION](img/malformated.PNG)

So I looked for the `KRB5KDC_ERR_BADOPTION` and found that :

>The most common scenario is a request for a delegated ticket (unconstrained or constrained delegation). You will typically see this on the middle-tier server trying to access a back-end server. There are several reasons for rejection:
1. The service account is not trusted for delegation
2. The service account is not trusted for delegation to the SPN requested
3. The userâ€™s account is marked as sensitive
4. The request was for a constrained delegation ticket to itself (constrained delegation is designed to allow a middle tier service to request a ticket to a back end service on behalf on another user, not on behalf of itself).

I finally figured out that I configured, on my first week of this internship when installing my environment, **a trusted on the AF** _(Cf. DAS manual in which is explained how to configure this)_ server and not only on the domain controller. So this finally explained a lot of strange happening that I could not understand on this ODBC client behavior.

From here, I finally could build the project and every configuration was now coherent with y understanding of the issue. This was the first step which was quite important : understand what is the current solution using, what are the issues and what can we try to change to fixe those.

## What I have to do

Change the connection between ODBC DAS and AF so  it can use delegation without trusting the Data access server.

## Appendix
### Questions I had:

* What release currently uses ?
> Everything is using Gsoap, and winHTTP to communicate with DAS
* Should I automatically get a krb ticket ?
> Not with the version he did but if we want to release it, it should be part of the software
* How can I enable winhttp in project ?
> The token is automatically generated and handled by microsoft libraries with the option AUTOLOGON SECURITY LEVEL LOW.
* When is GSS-API using openSSL if used with GSoap
> Encryption
* Does winHTTP really need DS intervention ?
> Yes, I had configurated a trust on the AF server
* How can I see ticket's flags when using TCT of https connection ?
> I can't

### What are the differets solutions :
1. Using GSS-API, but **still dependant of OpenSSL**
2. Using winHTTP and **configure Domain Controller to trust de DAS**  : *No good : no DC rights*
3. Using one of the both and **configure the DAS to be PrincipalAllowedToDelegateToAccount**  *No good no AF rights*
