# OSISoft Internship - Week 9

Here is a quick summary of my ninth week.

## Where I was

After studying the different options I had last week, it turned out that my best chances seem to be using winHTTP with the GSoap plugin, but I will have to find new possibilities to configure this plugin.


## What I did

### Tracing the connection

#### Using WinHTTP
First, I tried to trace the connection, using **fiddler** on both the ODEBC Client and the DASA and also regarding which connection attempt can I see in the **AF Logs**.

> Note: I use stateless connection so I only see the sessions corresponding to the authentication.

<div class="codeTitle">Request : </div>
```
Client :
  gSoap/2.8
Security :
  Authorization: Negociate
  Authorization Header (Negotiate) appears to contain a Kerberos ticket:
```
<div class="codeTitle">Answer : </div>
```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized :
  Cookies ? Login :
    WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate
    WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=""
    connection: close
```

On the data access server, we can see one connection from the ODBC User that should be then forwarded. but the second one is "ANONYMOUS LOGON" and I think this may be the problem already :

![logon](img/logon.png)

Finally I have the same error as for the second hop on the DAS on the AF logs, so the connection is still forwarded even if it does not succeed.

### Building demo client Microsoft SSPI SECURE32.dll

### Preparing presentation

As I will have to present my work and my subject to the company, I also decided this week to start preparing this presentation. The plan will surely look like something like this :
---
I   - Introdution
  1. Who am I ?
  2. Where was I ?
---
II  - Project presentation
  1. Internship project 2017
  2. context
  3. Project Overview
---
III - First task : GSS-ASI, Connection Delay
  1. Kerberos
  2. GSS Application
  3. My preject (demo)
  4. Problem solution
---
IV  - Second Task : No more OpenSSL
  1. What is OpenSSL ?
  1. What is it used for ?
  1. GSS API without OpenSSL ?
  1. Delegation using winHTTP
---
V   - What did I learn
  1. Technical
  2. Relational
  3. Organizationel
--- 
VI  - Q&A


#### Kerberos overview

Just to remember and clarify what I know from Kerberos, I read some documentation and wrote a small overview :

Three-headed guard dog of Hades Greek mythology : Third part = TDC
##### It allows:
*	Authentication
*	Ticket
*	No password sending

#### It is composed of:
*	Kerbors realm
  *	One KDC
    *	Authentication server
    *	Ticket Granting server
  *	Clients
  *	Services

Ticket = proof of identity
One service = one ticket
Created localy
Use ticket instead of password (Trusted connection)

#### Step 1 – You – Authentication Server

1.	When you connect, you send a request for a Ticket Granting Ticket with your ID address etc.
2.	AS checks if you exist in his database (no cred test)
3.	Generating session key for TGS
4.	Send you TGS session key encrypted with you Client Secret key witch you can obtain with your password
5.	But cannot read the TGT (need TSG secret key and not session key) (One you can read not the other)

#### Step 2 – You – TGS

1.	You have the TGT, and TGS session Key
2.	You send Authenticator encrypted with TGS session key
3.	TGS -> KDC database -> Service exists
4.	TGT contains TGS session key -> dept evering
Then :
*	Compare ID
*	Timestamp 2min no more
*	Lifetime
*	TGS’s cache (reply attack)
*	Network address
5.	Returns HTTP Session Key with HTTP secret key

#### Step 3 – You and HTTP Service

1.	You send your ticket for HTTP service
2.	Service decrypt with secret key
3.	Send back his ticket generated by admin
4.	You check
5.	Then can use this ticket which is cached


``` c++
gss_init_sec_context(&minStat, &ctx, servName, &gss_krb5_mech_oid_desc, ...);
```


## What I have to do
